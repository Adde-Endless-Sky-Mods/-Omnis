# Omnis
This project persists as the most extensive all-content plugin to date! From installation, there will be a new wormhole in Rutilicus and additional wormholes in each species' capital system all leading the player to the Omnis galaxy. Omnis is represented as a miniaturized copy of the Milky Way galaxy with specialized all-content systems for each of the game species.
Additional features:
- Near unlimited credits are given to the player
- Ability to change the players' swizzle to any of the supported 29 ship overlays
- Automatic mapping of all vanilla systems and wormholes
- Arena to challenge a representative ship of any vanilla species
- Invulnerable developer ship and outfits capable of exploring the map of the game with ease
