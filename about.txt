This project persists as the most extensive all-content plugin to date! From installation, there will be a new wormhole in Rutilicus and additional wormholes in each species' capital system all leading the player to the Omnis galaxy. Omnis is represented as a miniaturized copy of the Milky Way galaxy with specialized all-content systems for each of the game species.
